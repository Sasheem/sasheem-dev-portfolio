### About this project
<p>This project was previously set up using Google's Cloud Platform to run the backend. The contact form invoked 
a firebase cloud function to send an email when triggered by database write event.</p> 

<p>Now my static site is backed by serverless aws lambda functions. I switched to this setup because I recently obtained my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification.</p>

<p>I created the mockups for each project using Sketch and designed the logo playing around with 
shapes in Sketch</p>
