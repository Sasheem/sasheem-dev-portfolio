### About this project
Previously I had my portfolio site set up using Google's Cloud Platform to run the backend. This involved calling on a firebase cloud function to send an email when triggered by database write.
I switched to this current setup after obtaining my AWS Cloud Practicioner certification. Now my static site is backed by serverless aws lambda functions. I created the mockups for each project using Sketch and designed the my logo playing around with shapes in Sketch.

### Dev Stack
- Gatsby JS
- Styled Components
- Netlify hosting
- Amazon Gateway API
