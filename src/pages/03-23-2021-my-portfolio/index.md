### About this project
Previously I had my portfolio site set up using Google's Cloud Platform to run the backend. 
I switched to this current setup after obtaining my AWS Cloud Practicioner certification. I created the mockups
for each project using Sketch and designed the my logo playing around with shapes in Sketch.

### Dev Stack
- Gatsby JS
- Styled Components
- Amazon S3 Hosting
- Amazon Gateway API
- Amazon Lambda function
- Sketch design tool
