### About this project
I designed and developed this mobile app for users working in the hospitality industry to keep track of their
tips and wages earned. The user enters in their earnings, hours worked, job worked and any notes about the shift for a specific day and the app uses this collection of information to show you metrics about your input. The app runs on both iOS and Android using Expo. I'm hoping to get it up on both app stores soon.
