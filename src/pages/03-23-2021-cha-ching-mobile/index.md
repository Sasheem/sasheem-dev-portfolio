### About this project
<p>I designed and developed this mobile app for users working in the hospitality industry to keep track of their
tips and wages earned.<p>

<p>The user enters in their earnings, hours worked, job worked and any notes about the shift for a specific day and the app uses this collection of information to show the user metrics.</p>

<p>The app runs on both iOS and Android using Expo. I'm working to get it up on both app stores soon.</p>
