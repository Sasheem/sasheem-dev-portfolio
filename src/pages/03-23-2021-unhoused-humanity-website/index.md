### About this project
Unhoused Humanity is a nonprofit that works to house individuals and families experiencing homelessness.
I volunteer for them by maintaining their website on Squarespace. I developed a new website with React to help
create an online community around this cause. Users can browse success stories and currently funded clients to crowdfund. In addition they can opt to create an account in order to track their impact on ending homelessness.
